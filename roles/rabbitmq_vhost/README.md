## Example Playbook

Here's an example playbook that configures a vhost `/prod/data-store` with three users, an exchange, and two queues. The exchange has two queues bound to it.

```yaml
- hosts: amqp_brokers
  roles:
    - role: cyverse.ds.rabbitmq_vhost
      rabbitmq_vhost_admin_username: admin
      rabbitmq_vhost_admin_password: password
      rabbitmq_vhost_name: /prod/data-store
      rabbitmq_vhost_users:
        - name: admin

          write_priv: .*
